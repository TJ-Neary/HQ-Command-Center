# CLAUDE.md — [Your Project Name]

> **Project instruction file.** AI coding agents read this file automatically when they open the project.
> Rename this file to `CLAUDE.md` and customize it for your project.

---

## Project Identity

**Name:** [Your Project Name]
**Description:** [One-line description of what this project does]
**Tech Stack:** [e.g., Python 3.12, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, pytest]
**Status:** [e.g., Active Development, Production, Maintenance]

---

## Quick Context Load

Before doing anything, read these files to understand context:

1. **`me/persona.md`** — Who the developer is (background, goals, preferences)
2. **`me/plan.md`** — Current priorities and active goals
3. **`sessions/session_memory.md`** — What happened in recent sessions

If this project has a `DevPlan.md`, also read it for current phase and roadmap.

---

## Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/gogogo` | Session startup — load context, check git, present priorities. See `commands/gogogo.md`. |
| `/wrapup` | Session close — commit, update session memory, handoff. See `commands/wrapup.md`. |

## Agent Coordination

<!-- Remove this section if you only use one AI agent -->

### Domain Lanes

Define which agent handles what to avoid conflicts:

| Domain | Primary Agent | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Source code (`src/`) | [Your engineering agent] | Implementation, refactoring, testing |
| Research (`research/`) | [Your research agent] | Web research, analysis, comparisons |
| Session files | All agents (append-only) | Every agent reads and writes session files |
| Git operations | [Your engineering agent] | Only one agent should commit |

### Session Memory Format

All agents use the same format when writing to `sessions/session_memory.md`:

```markdown
---
## [Date] — [Agent: TAG] — [Brief Title]
**Project:** [project name]

**What was done:**
- [Items]

**Files changed:**
- `path/to/file` — [what changed]

**Open items / handoff notes:**
- [Items for next session or other agents]
---
```

### Mid-Session Convention

Before starting any new major task, re-read `sessions/scratchpad.md` for notes other agents may have left. No agent has real-time file-change detection — you only see updates when you actively read.

---

## Working Preferences

<!-- Customize these for your working style -->

- **Communication:** Be direct and concise. Assume technical competence.
- **Code style:** Follow project conventions. Don't add comments for self-evident code.
- **Testing:** Write tests for new functionality. Run existing tests before committing.
- **Commits:** Use conventional commit format. Don't commit without asking first.

## Extension Points

<!-- Add project-specific sections below. Examples: -->

<!-- ### Standards Sync -->
<!-- If you maintain shared standards across projects, add sync logic here -->

<!-- ### CI/CD Integration -->
<!-- Project-specific build and deploy instructions -->

<!-- ### Environment Setup -->
<!-- Local development environment requirements -->
